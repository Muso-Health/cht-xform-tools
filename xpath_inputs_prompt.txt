indeed for each formula starting with the ../inputs or the ../../inputs string and if the formula is "path like" there
is a logic to get the meaning, first there are 3 folder name with special meaning, one is contact ../inputs/contact  or
../../inputs/contact refers to the form subject, this is the CHT contact about whom the form is collecting data.
A contact in the CHT can be a place of type c50_family, c40_chw_area, c30_supervisor_area, c20_health_area or c10_site,
each c50_family belongs to one and only one c40_chw_area and this to one c30_supervisor_area and this
to one c20_health_area and this to one and only one c10_site. The c10_site type places are the only to not have any
parent.
All places can have children of type person. In a place we can have a special person called the primary contact.
Patients are the children of c50_families , chw are the children of the c40_chw_area, chw_supervisor are the person children
 of the c30_supervisor_area. stock_manager and tb_focal_point are children of type person of a c20_health_area, finally
 chw_manager are the children of type person of a c10_site.

 The folder parent is used in combination with the contact folder, if ../inputs/contact  or
 ../../inputs/contact is a patient then  ../inputs/contact/parent or ../../inputs/contact/parent is a c50_family of
 the given contact. So ../inputs/contact/parent/parent/contact or ../../inputs/contact/parent/parent/contact is the primary
 contact of the  c40_chw_area of the patient, this is, the only chw that is primary contact.
 For each XForm we need to know  which CHT contact type is represented by  ../inputs/contact or ../../inputs/contact and
 apply this logic to know which contact is represented and which property of the contact. '{explanation}'

 Generate a brief, one-sentence description for each language.
 for ../inputs/contact/parent/parent/contact/name with ../inputs/contact being a patient a good description is 'CHW name'
 this is better than 'The formula refers to the name property of the chw primary contact, which belongs to the parent
 place of the patient's c50_family.'

            Your response MUST be a valid JSON object.
            The JSON object MUST have exactly three keys: "fr", "en", and "bm".
            The value for each key MUST be a simple string. DO NOT use nested objects.

            Correct format example:
            {{
                "fr": "Description in French.",
                "en": "Description in English.",
                "bm": "Description in Bamanankan."
            }}
